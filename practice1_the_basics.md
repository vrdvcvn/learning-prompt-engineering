Good afternoon, NBA fans around the world.

What a spectacular conclusion to the 2024-2025 season. A thrilling seven-game Finals series was the perfect ending to a year that showcased the heart, dedication, and unparalleled skill of our athletes. On behalf of the league office, I want to thank you, the fans, for bringing the energy every single night.

The level of talent we are witnessing across the league is simply staggering. The statistics this year are truly mind-blowing, and the bar for individual excellence continues to rise every season. As we close the book on this year, I want to take a moment to highlight the individual scoring leaders who captivated us all season long. It is my honor to announce the top five scorers of the 2025 NBA season.

Coming in at number five... a name that continues to defy time itself. From the Los Angeles Lakers, LeBron James, with an average of 26.2 points per game! In his 22nd season, to perform at this level is a testament to a consistency and greatness we may never see again. Truly historic.

At number four... the two-time MVP from the Denver Nuggets, Nikola Jokić, with an average of 29.7 points per game! An offensive hub unlike any other, whose scoring is just one facet of his complete dominance on the court.

Our third leading scorer... 'The Greek Freak,' Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, with an incredible 31.5 points per game! And let's not forget, he accomplished this while returning from a minor leg injury late in the season, showing incredible resilience and determination.

The runner-up for the scoring title this year... from the Oklahoma City Thunder, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, with a phenomenal 32.8 points per game! What a season! His creativity and mastery in the mid-range were on full display every single night.

And now, your 2025 NBA Scoring Champion... from the Dallas Mavericks, Luka Dončić, with a mind-blowing average of 34.1 points per game! Simply sensational! A masterful performance from start to finish, and a joy for all of us to watch.

These five athletes represent the pinnacle of our league, and we are incredibly proud of their accomplishments this season.

As we look ahead, I know the excitement is already building. I am pleased to announce that the 2025-2026 NBA season will officially tip off on Tuesday, October 21st, 2025. We are also thrilled to confirm the return of the NBA Paris Game next January, as we continue to bring our game to our incredible fans across the globe.

Thank you, and get ready for another incredible year of NBA basketball.

Alright everyone, let's take a breath!

What an absolutely incredible 2023 NBA season. A huge congratulations to the Denver Nuggets on their spectacular championship run. That final game was a nail-biter that had all of us on the edge of our seats.

You know, every year I look at the stat sheets, and every year I think, "There's no way these players can get any better." And every single year, they prove me wrong. The talent level across this league is simply mind-blowing. The way these guys are scoring the basketball... I'm starting to think the rims are getting wider, but our analytics department assures me they're not. It's just pure, unadulterated skill.

Now, let's talk about the individuals who were filling up the box score like it was a grocery list. These are the top 5 scoring machines from this past season, the guys who had defenders waking up in a cold sweat.

***

* **Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers):** The MVP himself, leading the league with a jaw-dropping **33.1 points per game**! "The Process" was simply an unstoppable force in the paint and from mid-range. You couldn't stop him; you could only hope to contain him. What a season for the big man!

* **Luka Dončić (Dallas Mavericks):** Is anyone surprised to see this man here? Luka Magic was in full effect, putting up an astounding **32.4 points per game**. He's a walking triple-double who scores from every spot on the floor. The things he does with a basketball are just a joy to watch.

* **Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers):** You all know what time it is! DAME TIME! Averaging a spectacular **32.2 points per game**. When the game is on the line, there are few people you'd rather have with the ball. He was pulling up from the logo like it was a layup!

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder):** The smoothest operator in the game had his superstar breakout season! SGA put the league on notice with a silky **31.4 points per game**. He gets to his spots better than anyone, and that young OKC team is looking scary for the future.

* **Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks):** Here comes the Greek Freak! A runaway freight train to the basket, Giannis dominated his way to **31.1 points per game**. The power, the skill, the will to win—it’s an incredible combination that makes him one of the league's very best.

***

Of course, the conversation doesn't end there. How can you look at any list without mentioning LeBron James? Nearing two decades in the league and still a top-tier scorer. The man is just defying father time, and his consistency is a benchmark for greatness.

Now, looking around the league, the offseason is already buzzing. We've seen some league-altering moves. How about Damian Lillard, one of the guys on our list, heading to Milwaukee to team up with Giannis? That's a duo that's going to give defensive coordinators nightmares!

It wasn't all good news, of course. We have to send our best wishes to players who battled injuries. It was tough to see Zion Williamson's season cut short with that hamstring injury just as the Pelicans were hitting their stride. A healthy Zion is a force of nature, and we can't wait to have him back at 100%.

And looking ahead... have you all seen the footage from France? A young man named Victor Wembanyama is on his way, and believe me when I tell you, you have never seen anything like him. He's going to change the geometry of the game.

It's been an honor to witness this season with all of you. Get some rest, because the 2023-2024 season is right around the corner.

Mark your calendars, folks. We tip off in **October 2023**! Get ready!

Well, hello everyone, and what a season it has been!

Another incredible NBA season is in the books, and I want to give a massive congratulations to the Denver Nuggets on a hard-fought, spectacular championship victory. The champagne has barely dried, but my head is still spinning from the level of talent we witnessed this year.

Every season, I think to myself, "There's no way these athletes can get any better." And every season, they prove me wrong. The scoring numbers this year were simply mind-blowing. I think some teams forgot that the goal is also to stop the *other* guys from scoring, but hey, it makes for a great show! The league is in an amazing place, and the talent pool is deeper than ever.

Now, for the part you've all been waiting for. Let's talk about the guys who were filling up the stat sheet like it was their full-time job... which, I guess, it is. Here are your top 5 scorers for the 2022-2023 NBA season!

***

* **Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers):** The MVP himself, leading the league with a colossal average of **33.1 points per game!** The Process has officially been trusted, and the payoff was an absolutely dominant season from the big man. Unstoppable in the post!

* **Luka Dončić (Dallas Mavericks):** Is it magic? No, it's just Luka! This man put the team on his back with an absurd **32.4 points per game.** We're watching a legend in the making, folks. He gets any shot he wants, whenever he wants it. Just incredible.

* **Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers):** You all know what time it is! "Dame Time" was running 48 minutes a night this season, as he dropped a career-high **32.2 points per game.** The man's range starts the second he steps into the arena. Absolutely fearless!

* **Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Oklahoma City Thunder):** The smoothest operator in the game had his breakout superstar season, putting up a silky **31.4 points per game!** SGA was a walking bucket, and he's turned OKC into a team nobody wants to face. What a leap he's made!

* **Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks):** The Greek Freak continues to be a force of nature, powering his way to **31.1 points per game!** How do you even stop a 7-footer who can move like a guard? The answer is: you usually don't. A true marvel to watch!

***

Now, you can't talk about scoring without mentioning Mr. Consistency himself, **LeBron James**. In his 20th season—let me repeat that, *twentieth*—he was still putting up nearly 29 points a night. Does this guy ever age? I'm starting to think he's a real-life superhero.

Of course, the season had its tough moments. It was heartbreaking to see **Zion Williamson** go down with that hamstring injury right when he was playing like an MVP candidate. The league is simply more exciting when he's on the floor, and we are all wishing him a full and speedy recovery for next season.

Looking ahead, the offseason is already shaping up to be a wild one. I'm hearing all sorts of chatter, especially about one of the names on our top-scorer list. The rumors around **Damian Lillard** and a potential move to Milwaukee to team up with Giannis are fascinating. Could you imagine those two on the same team? The rest of the league might want to start game-planning for that *now*.

And if you're not excited enough, we have an absolute phenom on the way. A 7-foot-4 French prospect who moves like a guard and can protect the rim like a center. Get ready for the **Victor Wembanyama** era, because what I've seen from him looks like a video game cheat code.

It’s going to be a thrilling summer, but don't worry, the wait won't be too long. Get ready to do it all over again, because the 2023-2024 NBA season will officially tip off in **October 2023!**

Thank you to the fans for making this season one of the best yet. See you all court-side.
