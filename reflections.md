# What I Have Learned

## 20/08/2025

> Today I completed 2 lectures and a practice from the course. I learnt some of the key elements for prompting. I learnt the steps for writing an effective prompt. I applied these to do a practice of prompting. I figured out how to create a role and give background to have a person and I learnt how to give instructions and constraints to have a good result. It was important to give correct examples correct dates and not rely on future fictional data. It was important to give constraints and leave a space for creativity of the LLM. I worked with gemini to get test results. I identified multiple issues and repeated to fix any problems.
